<p id="ArtiWord">Camp John Hay used to be the rest and recreational facility for employees of the military and Department of Defense of the United States. This 690-hectare property was turned over to the Philippine government in July 1, 1991 and was initially administered by the Philippine Tourism Authority and then turned over to the Bases Conversion Development.

The facility, which was named after U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt's secretary of war, was used by the Japanese as a concentration camp for American and British soldiers during the war. Its name was changed to Club John Hay after it was turned over to the Philippine government. For the first time in its history the facility was open to the public in 1991 and converted into a recreational complex. It used to be off-limits to Filipinos, except for the privileged few who could get entry passes from its former American administrators.

Prior to its turnover to the Philippine government, there were 290 fully-furnished rooms in the different cottages, duplexes, apartments, and lodges which are distributed in different locations around the complex. It even had a "Honeymoon Cottage" which was rented out to newlyweds who come up to Baguio for their honeymoon. Some of these billeting units were equipped with color television sets, refrigerators, and cooking facilities. Each unit has a fireplace to keep you warm during the months of December, January and February when the weather in Baguio is quite chilly and cold.</p>


  <p id="ArtiWord">For those interested in playing golf, Camp John Hay has a 5,330-yard, 18-hole, par-68 golf course which is one of the best in the country. There is a new golf clubhouse which has a restaurant and function rooms that cater to golfers, visitors, and also the local residents of Baguio. Around the complex there are beautiful gardens, picnic areas, parks, an ampitheater, and hiking trails that wind through the rolling hills and pine trees within the former military reservation.</p>
