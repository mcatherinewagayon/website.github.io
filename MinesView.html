    <p id="ArtiWord">There is no doubt that the Mines View Park is one of the most popular and most visited park in the city. From the observation deck of the park a breathtaking panoramic view of Benguet's gold and copper mines and the surrounding mountains unfolds before you. It is a spectacular sight to behold and should not be missed when visiting Baguio.</p>


  <p id="ArtiWord">The park is usually the next stop taken by most visitors after seeing the Mansion or Wright Park. To reach the observation deck, you need to go down a winding stone-covered stairway which is just close to the parking area. One should be careful when ascending or descending the stairway just after a rain as the steps can be very slippery. There are a few benches at the promontory where you can sit down to rest and enjoy the view. For a few pesos you can rent a binocular and there are also some commercial photographers around just in case you want to have your picture taken. A visit to the park should also be planned earlier during the day as the view may not be visible when the fog starts to move in during the afternoon. However, this occurs only on certain months of the year.</p>

<p id="ArtiWord">
At the entrance to the park are stalls selling native handicraft such as wood carvings, locally made silver products and jewelry, baskets, brooms, sweaters, blankets, and a variety of other items. There are also canteens, snack stores, and street vendors selling food and beverages. Items one will find here are similar to those found in the public market but only at a much smaller scale. There are however some good bargains at the stores and it is best to check and compare prices before deciding to purchase a particular item. There is an open parking area at the vicinity of the park where the stores are located.</p>
