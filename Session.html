<p id="ArtiWord">Session Road is the main thoroughfare of the city and the center of Baguio's commercial establishment. This is where you will find department stores, banks, movie houses, and bazaars. There are also some hotels, bakeries, restaurants, newspaper stands, bookstores, boutiques, cafes, and studios along Session Road.</p>

<p id="ArtiWord">Local residents, students in the different schools and universities in the city and visitors alike spend most of their free time just going up and down Session Road. It is a place to go window shopping, looking at people, or just taking a leisurely walk during a cool and quite afternoon or evening. Visitors should take note that residents of Baguio City are predominantly Catholics and when the Angelus (a Catholic devotion in honor of Annunciation and Incarnation) is supposed to be recited in the evening at 6:00 o'clock, a loud continuous siren is heard all over the city to remind everyone about it.</p>
